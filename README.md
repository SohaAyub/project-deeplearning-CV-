This project uses a CNN to classify facial expressions into 7 categories (Happy, Sad, Angry, etc.). It features data augmentation, model checkpoints, and performance evaluation with confusion matrices and accuracy/loss plots. The model is trained on a 48x48 grayscale dataset using TensorFlow/Keras. ðŸŽ­ðŸ“Š
